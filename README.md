# 🧠 Activity Level Prediction using KNN

This project predicts the activity level (High, Medium, Low) using motion sensor data with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## 📌 Features Used
- Steps Per Day
- Calories Burned
- Sleep Duration (Hours)
- Water Intake (Liters)

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Gradio (for deployment)

## 🚀 Model Highlights
- Data Preprocessing (null handling, normalization, encoding)
- Model selection using cross-validation
- Accuracy ≈ 40% (baseline), with scope for optimization
- Classification Report + Confusion Matrix + ROC Curve
- Real-time prediction using Gradio

## 📊 Dataset
Custom-created using simulated health sensor data. Stored as `KNN_Human_Fitness_Dataset.csv`

## 🧰 How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Modify test data to try new predictions
